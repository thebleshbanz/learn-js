### Stack

A stack data structure holds a list of elements and works on the principle of LIFO (Last in, First out). This means the element that is added most recently is also the element to be removed first. There are two main operations that occur at the top of the stack, which are push and pop. With the push method, you can add one or more elements to the end of the array. However, with the pop method, you can get rid of the element at the end of the array, which is then returned to the caller.


### Queue

While similar to stacks in terms of concepts, queues, unlike stacks that process the elements based on recent ones entered, process the elements in the entered order. So, when you want to store the requests in the order they were received in, you can use a queue. To give an example, here’s a utilization of an array to run a queue.

### Linked List

Linked lists use a referencing system instead of using physical placements of data in the memory. Linked lists store the elements in nodes. These nodes contain a pointer to the subsequent node, which creates a link between all the nodes. With a linked list system, you can efficiently insert and remove the items without reorganizing. Here’s an example for Linked List using nodes-
